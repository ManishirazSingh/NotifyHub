# NotifyHub

NotifyHub is a distributed notification processing platform being built using production-style backend engineering patterns with Java and Spring Boot.

The architecture, module boundaries, and implementation roadmap are defined in docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md.

## Current Status

Phase 6 Status — Consumers Created ✅

Implemented independent Email and SMS consumer microservices using Apache Kafka with shared event contracts through a common library.

## ✅ What is implemented in Phase 6

### Consumer Services
- Independent Email Service and SMS Service microservices
- Shared event contracts through common-lib
- Kafka consumers using @KafkaListener

### Event Processing
- Email Service processes EMAIL notifications
- SMS Service processes SMS notifications
- Event filtering based on NotificationType

### Microservice Architecture
- Notification Service publishes events only
- Consumer services process notifications independently
- Shared DTOs and enums extracted into common-lib


## Notification API

Base URL for local development:

http://localhost:8081

---

### POST /notifications

Creates a notification request and persists it into PostgreSQL.

Example:
POST http://localhost:8081/notifications  
-Header "Content-Type: application/json"  
-body '{ "userId": "user-123", "type": "EMAIL", "title": "Welcome", "message": "Hello from NotifyHub" }'

Expected response:

{
"notificationId": "generated-uuid",
"status": "QUEUED",
"type": "EMAIL",
"createdAt": "timestamp"
}

---

### GET /notifications/{id}

Fetches a persisted notification from PostgreSQL.

Example:
GET http://localhost:8081/notifications/{notificationId}

Expected response:

{
"notificationId": "uuid",
"status": "QUEUED",
"type": "EMAIL",
"createdAt": "timestamp"
}

##  Database Schema (Flyway Managed)

Table: notifications

Columns:
- id (UUID / VARCHAR) — Primary Key
- user_id (VARCHAR)
- type (VARCHAR)
- title (VARCHAR)
- message (TEXT)
- status (VARCHAR stored as ENUM STRING)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP generated via @PrePersist)

Table outbox_events

Columns:
- id (UUID / VARCHAR) — Primary Key
- aggregate_id (VARCHAR)
- event_type (VARCHAR)
- payload (VARCHAR)
- status (VARCHAR stored as ENUM STRING)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP generated via @PrePersist)

## Current State

Multi-module Maven setup  
API Gateway running  
Notification Service running  
PostgreSQL integration complete  
Flyway schema migrations active
